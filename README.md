# Launchess - Play Chess on a Launchpad!

This is a crazy idea I had whilst noticing that a chess board (an 8x8 grid) is the same as a Novation Launchpad (an 8x8 grid of programmable buttons).
Since Novation Launchpads have a MIDI interface detailed in a specification, I've decided to try and make a (limited looking) chess game on it.

I plan to hook it up to the Lichess.org api too, so that you can play against real players using the Launchpad, and see their moves in real-time.
